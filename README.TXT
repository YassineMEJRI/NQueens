PROJECT TITLE: Solving the „N-Queens Problem“

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Problem Description:
                    The original problem is to place eight queens of a classic chess game on a standard 8 x 8
                    chessboard such that they do not harm each other.
                    This project solves the same problem generalized to an n-queens problem. Meaning any given size of a chessboard.
                    Another aspect of the solution is that it can calculate all available solutions for the N-queens problem up to the size of 12 and to visualize them on a chessboard

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
                    First approach: Open the source code in any IDE (like IntelliJ) and run the main method in Main.java file.
                    Second approach: Execute the JAR file under /out/artifacts/Chess_board_jar/"Chess board.jar" using `java -jar` command on the terminal or by double clicking on the file.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
                    One the application is launched a pop up will prompt the user to introduce the size of the checkers (or 'N').
                    Once the user clicks on the "OK" button a new window will open showing a board with the size that was previously introduced (N x N).
                    On the board there will be showcased the first solution to the problem (an arrangement of N queens that don't attack each other).
                    On the bottom of the screen there will be a "Next Solution" button. Each time this button is clicked a new solution to the same problem will be showcased on the chess board.
